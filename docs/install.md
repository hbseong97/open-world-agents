# Installation Guide

## Quick Start

**If you want super-quick-start, skip and head to `pip` install guide in [below](#installation-33).**

## Install from Source

### Setup Virtual Environment (1/3)

Before installation, we recommend setting up a virtual environment.

=== "conda/mamba"

    1. Follow the [miniforge installation guide](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install) to install `conda` and `mamba`. `mamba` is just a faster `conda`. If you've already installed `conda`, you may skip this step.

    2. Create & activate your virtual environment:
       ```sh
       $ conda create -n owa python=3.11 -y
       $ conda activate owa
       ```

    3. (Optional) For Windows users who need desktop recorder:
       ```sh
       $ mamba env update --name owa --file projects/owa-env-gst/environment.yml
       ```

!!! tip

    You can use other virtual environment tools, but to fully utilize `owa-env-gst`, you must install GStreamer with `conda/mamba`.
    
    Note: GStreamer is only needed if you plan to capture screens.

### Setup `uv` (2/3)

We recommend setting up `uv` next:

1. Follow the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or simply run `pip install uv` in your activated environment.

2. Install `virtual-uv` package:
   ```sh
   $ pip install virtual-uv
   $ vuv install
   ```

!!! tip

    Always activate your virtual environment before running any `vuv` commands.

### Installation (3/3)

=== "uv"

    ```sh
    # Ensure you're at project root
    $ pwd
    ~/open-world-agents

    $ uv sync --inexact
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```sh
    # Ensure you're at project root
    $ pwd
    ~/open-world-agents

    # Install core first
    $ pip install -e projects/owa-core

    # Install supporting packages
    $ pip install -e projects/mcap-owa-support
    $ pip install -e projects/owa-desktop
    $ pip install -e projects/owa-env-gst

    # Install CLI
    $ pip install -e projects/owa-cli
    ```

    !!! tip
        When using `pip` instead of `uv`, **the installation order matters** because `pip` can't recognize `[tool.uv.sources]` in `pyproject.toml`.

## Install from PyPI & conda-forge (WIP)

- PyPI packages:
  - `owa-core`: Contains only the core logic to manage OWA's EnvPlugin
  - `owa`: Contains several base EnvPlugins along with `owa-core` (requires separate GStreamer installation)

- Conda packages:
  - `owa`: Complete package with EnvPlugins and core functionality
